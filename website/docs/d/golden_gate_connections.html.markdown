This data source provides the list of Connections in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Golden Gate service.

Lists the Connections in the compartment.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_golden_gate_connections" "test_connections" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	assignable_deployment_id = oci_golden_gate_deployment.test_deployment.id
	assignable_deployment_type = var.connection_assignable_deployment_type
	assigned_deployment_id = oci_golden_gate_deployment.test_deployment.id
	connection_type = var.connection_connection_type
	display_name = var.connection_display_name
	state = var.connection_state
	technology_type = var.connection_technology_type
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `assignable_deployment_type` - (Optional) Filters for connections which can be assigned to the latest version of the specified deployment type. 
* `assigned_deployment_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the deployment which for the connection must be assigned. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment in which to list resources. 
* `connection_type` - (Optional) The array of connection types. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only the resources that match the entire 'displayName' given. 
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only connections having the 'lifecycleState' given. 
* `technology_type` - (Optional) The array of technology types. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `connection_collection` - The list of connection_collection.

### Connection Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `account_name` - Sets the Azure storage account name. 
* `additional_attributes` - An array of name-value pair attribute entries. Used as additional parameters in connection string. 
	* `name` - The name of the property entry. 
	* `value` - The value of the property entry. 
* `authentication_type` - Used authentication mechanism to access Azure Data Lake Storage. 
* `azure_tenant_id` - Azure tenant ID of the application. This property is required when 'authenticationType' is set to 'AZURE_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY'. e.g.: 14593954-d337-4a61-a364-9f758c64f97f
* `bootstrap_servers` - Kafka bootstrap. Equivalent of bootstrap.servers configuration property in Kafka: list of KafkaBootstrapServer objects specified by host/port. Used for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. Example: `"server1.example.com:9092,server2.example.com:9092"` 
	* `host` - The name or address of a host. 
	* `port` - The port of an endpoint usually specified for a connection. 
	* `private_ip` - The private IP address of the connection's endpoint in the customer's VCN, typically a database endpoint or a big data endpoint (e.g. Kafka bootstrap server). In case the privateIp is provided, the subnetId must also be provided. In case the privateIp (and the subnetId) is not provided it is assumed the datasource is publicly accessible. In case the connection is accessible only privately, the lack of privateIp will result in not being able to access the connection.
* `client_id` - Azure client ID of the application. This property is required when 'authenticationType' is set to 'AZURE_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY'. e.g.: 06ecaabf-8b80-4ec8-a0ec-20cbf463703d 
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment being referenced. 
* `connection_string` - JDBC connection string. e.g.: 'jdbc:sqlserver://<synapse-workspace>.sql.azuresynapse.net:1433;database=<db-name>;encrypt=true;trustServerCertificate=false;hostNameInCertificate=*.sql.azuresynapse.net;loginTimeout=300;'
* `connection_type` - The connection type. 
* `database_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the database being referenced. 
* `database_name` - The name of the database. 
* `db_system_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the database system being referenced. 
* `defined_tags` - Tags defined for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace.  Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `deployment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the deployment being referenced. 
* `description` - Metadata about this specific object. 
* `display_name` - An object's Display Name.
* `endpoint` - Azure Storage service endpoint. e.g: https://test.blob.core.windows.net
* `freeform_tags` - A simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type, or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only.  Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `host` - The name or address of a host. 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the connection being referenced.
